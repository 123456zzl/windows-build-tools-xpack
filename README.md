# The Windows Build Tools

Traditionally Windows systems do not provide any standard __make__ programs, and without one building Eclipse managed projects is not possible (using the internal builder is highly discouraged, since it is no longer supported).

These are the files used to build the Windows versions of the __make__ & __rm__.

The build procedure is described in the [wiki page](http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/wiki/How_to_build_the_Windows_Build_Tools).
